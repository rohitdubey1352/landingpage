# React + Vite

After downloading this project, user need to install the packages.
Use this command:


**cd project name**


**npm install**


**npm init**

**npm run dev**

I had build the landing page using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript & React js.

I have used react for better user performance and make the website works fast, with that I had used components to add in the main file.




This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
